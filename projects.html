							<h2>MARINER PROGRAM </h2>
							<h3>1962 - 1973</h3>
							<a><img src="images/mariner.jpg" alt=""><b>Launch of Mariner 1 in 1962</b></a>
							<div><br>
								<p>The Mariner program was conducted by the American space agency NASA to explore other planets. Between 1962 and late 1973, 
									NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) designed and built 10 robotic interplanetary probes named Mariner to explore the 
									inner Solar System - visiting the planets Venus, Mars and Mercury for the first time, and returning to Venus and Mars for
									additional close observations.<br>
									Launch of Mariner 1 in 1962
									The program included a number of interplanetary firsts, including the first planetary flyby, the planetary orbiter, and the
									first gravity assist maneuver.[2] Of the 10 vehicles in the Mariner series, seven were successful, forming the starting point
									for many subsequent NASA/JPL space probe programs. The planned Mariner</p>

							<h2>MARINER 2 PROGRAM</h2>
							<h3>1962 - 1973</h3>
							<a><img src="images/2mariner.jpg" alt=""><b>Robotic Space probe</b></a>
							<div>
								<p>Mariner 2 (Mariner-Venus 1962), an American space probe to Venus, was the first robotic space probe to
									 report successfully from a planetary encounter. The first successful spacecraft in the NASA Mariner 
									 program, it was a simplified version of the Block I spacecraft of the Ranger program and an exact 
									 copy of Mariner 1. <br>The missions of the Mariner 1 and 2 spacecraft are sometimes known as the Mariner
									  R missions. Original plans called for the probes to be launched on the Atlas-Centaur, but serious 
									  developmental problems with that vehicle forced a switch to the much smaller Agena B second stage. 
									  As such, the design of the Mariner R vehicles was greatly simplified.<br> Far less instrumentation was 
									  carried than on the Soviet Venera probes of this period—for example, forgoing a TV camera—as the 
									  Atlas-Agena B had only half as much lift capacity as the Soviet 8K78 booster. The Mariner 2 
									  spacecraft was launched from Cape Canaveral on August 27, 1962, and passed as close as 34,773 
									  kilometers (21,607 mi) to Venus on December 14, 1962.</p>

							<h2>THE EXPLORER PROGRAM</h2>
							<h3>1958 - present</h3>
							<a><img src="images/2explorer.jpg" alt=""><b>Explorer 1 satellite</b></a>
							<div>
								<p>The Explorer program has launched more than 90 missions since it began more than five decades ago.
									 It has matured into one of NASA's lower-cost mission programs.<br>

									The program started as a U.S. Army proposal to place a scientific satellite into orbit during the
									 International Geophysical Year (1957–58). However, that proposal was rejected in favor of the U.S.
									  Navy's Project Vanguard. <br>The Explorer program was later reestablished to catch up with the Soviet
									   Union after the launch of Sputnik 1 in October 1957.<br> Explorer 1 was launched January 31, 1958;
									    at this time the project still belonged to the Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA) and the Jet 
										Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Besides being the first U.S. satellite, it is known for discovering
										 the Van Allen radiation belt.</p>

							<h2>THE PIONEER PROGRAM </h2>
							<h3>1958 - 1978</h3>
							<a><img src="images/2pioneer.jpg" alt=""><b>Pioneer H in the National Air and Space Museum</b></a>
							<div><br><br>
								<p>The Pioneer program was a series of NASA uncrewed space missions designed for planetary exploration. 
									There were a number of missions in the program, most notably Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11, which explored
									 the outer planets and left the Solar System. Both carry a golden plaque, depicting a man and a woman
									  and information about the origin and the creators of the probes, should any extraterrestrials find 
									  them someday.<br>

									Additionally, the Pioneer mission to Venus consisted of two components, launched separately. 
									Pioneer Venus 1 (Pioneer Venus Orbiter) was launched in May 1978 and remained in orbit until 1992.
									 Pioneer Venus 2 (Pioneer Venus Multiprobe), launched in August 1978, sent four small probes into the 
									 Venusian atmosphere.</p>

							<h2>PROJECT ECHO</h2>
							<h3>1960 - 1964</h3>
							<a><img src="images/2project.jpg" alt=""><b>Echo 2 in a hanger,N.carolina.people can be seen on the floor</b></a>
							<div>
								<p>Project Echo was the first passive communications satellite experiment. Each spacecraft was a metalized
								 balloon satellite to be inflated in space and acting as a passive reflector of microwave signals.
								  Communication signals were bounced off of them from one point on Earth to another. NASA's Echo 1 
								  satellite was built by Gilmore Schjeldahl Company in Northfield, Minnesota.<br> Following the failure of
								   the Delta rocket carrying Echo 1 on May 13, 1960, Echo 1A was put successfully into orbit by another 
								   Thor-Delta, and the first microwave transmission was received on August 12, 1960.<br>

                                   Echo 2 was a 41.1-meter (135 ft) diameter metalized PET film balloon, which was the last balloon 
								   satellite launched by Project Echo. It used an improved inflation system to improve the balloon's 
								   smoothness and sphericity. It was launched January 25, 1964, on a Thor Agena rocket.</p>

							<h2>THE LUNAR ORBITER PROGRAM</h2>
							<h3>1966 - 1967</h3>
							<a><img src="images/2lunar.jpg" alt=""><b>Lunar Orbiter spacecraft(NASA)</b></a>
							<div>
								<p>The Lunar Orbiter program was a series of five uncrewed lunar orbiter missions launched by the United
									 States, starting in 1966. It was intended to help select landing sites for the Apollo program by
									  mapping the Moon's surface. The program produced the first photographs ever taken from lunar
									   orbit.<br>

									All five missions were successful, and 99% of the Moon was mapped from photographs taken with a 
									resolution of 60 meters (200 ft) or better. The first three missions were dedicated to imaging 20
									 potential human lunar landing sites, selected based on Earth-based observations. These were flown 
									 at low inclination orbits.<br> The fourth and fifth missions were devoted to broader scientific objectives
									 and were flown in high-altitude polar orbits. All Lunar Orbiter craft were launched by an 
									 Atlas-Agena D launch vehicle.</p>

							<h2>THE SURVEYOR PROGRAM</h2>
							<h3>1966 - 1968</h3>
							<a><img src="images/2surveyor.jpg" alt=""><b>Apollo 12 astronaut Pete Conrad inspecting Surveyors 3. Lunar Module is seen in the background. 1969</b></a>
							<div><br>
								<P>The Surveyor Program was a NASA program that, from 1966 through 1968, sent seven robotic spacecraft to
									 the surface of the Moon. Its primary goal was to demonstrate the feasibility of soft landings on the
									  Moon. The program was implemented by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to prepare for the Apollo
									   program. The total cost of the Surveyor program was officially $469 million.<br>

									Five of the Surveyor craft successfully soft-landed on the Moon. Two failed: Surveyor 2 crashed at high
									 velocity after a failed mid-course correction, and Surveyor 4 was lost for contact 2.5 minutes before 
									 its scheduled touch-down.<br>
									
									All seven spacecraft are still on the Moon; none of the missions included returning them to Earth. Some
									 parts of Surveyor 3 were returned to Earth by the crew of Apollo 12, which landed near it in 1969.</P>

							<h2>THE VOYAGER PROGRAM</h2>
							<h3>1977 - present</h3>
							<a><img src="images/2voyager.jpg" alt=""><b>Voyager probe</b></a>
							<div>
								<p>The Voyager program consists of a pair of uncrewed scientific probes, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2. They were 
									launched in 1977 to take advantage of a favorable planetary alignment of the late 1970s. Although they 
									were originally designated to study just Jupiter and Saturn, Voyager 2 was able to continue to Uranus
									and Neptune.<br> Both missions have gathered large amounts of data about the gas giants of the Solar System,
									of which little was previously known. Both probes have achieved escape velocity from the Solar System 
									and will never return. Voyager 1 entered interstellar space in 2012.<br>

									As of January 19, 2019, Voyager 1 was at a distance of 145.148 AU (13.492 billion miles (21.713×109 km)) 
									from Earth, traveling away from the Sun at a speed of about 10.6 mi/s (17.1 km/s), which corresponds to a
									greater specific orbital energy than any other probe.</p>

							<h2>MARS EXPLORATION ROVER MISSION</h2>
							<h3>2003 - 2019</h3>
							<a><img src="images/2explore.jpg" alt=""><b>Artist's conception of MER on Mars</b></a>
							<div><br><br>
								<p>NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Mission (MER), was a robotic space mission involving two rovers 
									exploring the planet Mars. The mission is managed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which 
									designed, built and is operating the rovers.<br>

									The mission began in 2003 with the sending of the two rovers—MER-A Spirit and MER-B Opportunity—to 
									explore the Martian surface and geology. The mission's scientific objective is to search for and study
									rocks and soils that indicate past water activity.<br> The mission is part of NASA's Mars Exploration
									Program which includes three previous successful landers: the two Viking program landers in 1976
									and Mars Pathfinder probe in 1997.</p>

							<h2>THE MESSENGER</h2>
							<h3>2004 - 2015</h3>
							<a><img src="images/2messenger.jpg" alt=""><b>MESSENGER (Artist concept)</b></a>
							<div>
								<p>MESSENGER (an acronym of MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging) was a robotic spacecraft that
									 orbited the planet Mercury, the first spacecraft to do so.The 485-kilogram (1,069 lb) spacecraft was launched 
									 aboard a Delta II rocket in August 2004 to study Mercury's chemical composition, geology, and magnetic field.<br>

									MESSENGER used its instruments on a complex series of flybys that allowed it to decelerate relative to Mercury 
									minimal fuel. The spacecraft flew by Earth once and Venus twice. Then it flew by Mercury three times, in January 2008,
									October 2008, and September 2009, becoming the second mission to reach Mercury, after Mariner 10. <br>MESSENGER
									entered orbit around Mercury on March 18, 2011, and it reactivated its science instruments on March 24, returning the 
									first photo from Mercury orbit on March 29.
									
									MESSENGER crashed into Mercury on April 30, 2015, after running out of propellant</p>

							<h2>THE MARS SCOUT PROGRAM</h2>
							<h3>2007 - 2008</h3>
							<a><img src="images/2scout.jpg" alt=""><b>Artist's impression of the phoenix spacecraft as it lands on Mars</b></a>
							<div>
								<p>The Mars Scout Program was a NASA initiative to send a series of small, low-cost robotic missions to Mars,
									 competitively selected from proposals by the scientific community. Each Scout project was to cost less 
									 than US$485 million. The Phoenix lander and MAVEN orbiter were selected and developed before the program
									  was retired in 2010.<br>

									Phoenix was a lander adapted from the canceled Mars Surveyor mission. Phoenix was launched on August 4,
									 2007, and landed in the icy northern polar region of the planet on May 25, 2008. Phoenix was designed to
									  search for environments suitable for microbial life on Mars and to research the history of water there.<br>
									  The 90-day primary mission was successful, and the overall mission was concluded on November 10,
									  2008, after engineers were unable to contact the craft. The lander last made a brief communication with
									   Earth on November 2, 2008.</p>

							<h2>MARS SCIENCE LABORATORY PROGRAM</h2>
							<h3>2011 - present</h3>
							<a><img src="images/2science.jpg" alt=""><b>Mars Curiosity Rover, Artist's concept</b></a>
							<div><br><br>
								<p>Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) is a NASA mission to land and operate a rover named Curiosity on the 
									surface of Mars. It was launched by an Atlas V rocket on November 26, 2011, and landed
									 successfully on August 6, 2012, on the plains of Aeolis Palus in Gale Crater near Aeolis Mons
									  (formerly Mount Sharp). On Mars, it is helping to assess Mars' habitability.
									   It can chemically analyze samples by scooping up soil and drilling rocks using a laser and sensor
									    system.<br>
									
									The Curiosity rover is about two times longer and fives times more massive than the Spirit or 
									Opportunity Mars Exploration Rovers and carries more than ten times the mass of scientific 
									instruments.</p>
