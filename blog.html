							<h2>INFERIOR CONJUNCTION OF VENUS</h2>
							<img src="images/venus.jpeg"  alt="member">
							<span>AUGUST 13, 2023</span>
								    Vedant Pandey wrote: “I am Vedant Pandey, a 17-year-old amateur astrophotographer from Varanasi, 
									Uttar Pradesh, India. I photographed Venus since it appeared in the evening sky in February, 2023. And here are the phases of Venus,
									 from waxing gibbous in February to its crescent phase in August, as seen by my telescope.” Wow! Thank you, Vedant! Venus will reach 
									 inferior conjunction – coming between us and the sun – this Sunday, August 13. And this sequence shows how much the planet’s appearance
									  has changed from our earthly perspective, as both Earth and Venus have moved in orbit throughout 2023. Thank you, Vedant! <br><br>

									<b>Venus in inferior conjunction</b><br>

									Venus travels one step inward from Earth in orbit around the sun. Its orbit is smaller than Earth’s. It has less distance to cover. And 
									it moves faster in orbit (about 35 km/s in contrast to about 30 km/s for Earth). Yet – because Earth travels fast, too – Venus manages to 
									gain a lap on us, going between us and the sun, only about every 19.5 months. And, at such times, earthly astronomers say Venus is in inferior
									 conjunction with the sun. Venus comes to inferior conjunction in 2023 at 11 UTC (6 a.m. CDT) on Sunday, August 13, 2023.

									Will you see Venus on the day of inferior conjunction? It’s not likely, unless you’re an extremely careful and experienced telescopic and/or 
									photographic observer. After all, on the day of inferior conjunction, Venus will be crossing the sky with the sun during the day.<br>

							<h2>ALIEN SIGNAL DISCOVERY</h2>
								<a><img src="images/alien.webp" alt=""></a>
								<span> MAY 30, 2023</span>
								    Could intelligent aliens be lurking at the heart of the Milky Way? 

									A new search for extraterrestrial life aims to find out by listening for radio pulses from the center of our galaxy. Narrow-frequency 
									pulses are naturally emitted by stars called pulsars, but they're also used deliberately by humans in technology such as radar.<br> Because 
									these pulses stand out against the background radio noise of space, they're an effective way of communicating across long distances — and 
									an appealing target to listen for when searching for alien civilizations.<br> 
									
									Scientists described the alien-hunting strategy in a new study, published May 30 in The Astronomical Journal. Researchers led by Cornell 
									University graduate student Akshay Suresh developed software to detect these repetitive frequency patterns and tested it on known pulsars
									to be sure it could pick up the narrow frequencies. These frequency ranges are very small, at about a tenth of the width of frequencies 
									used by a typical FM radio station. The researchers then searched data from the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia using the method.<br>

						    <h2>RUSSIA'S MOON ROCKET BLASTS OFF</h2>

							    <span> AUGUST 11, 2023</span>
							        A Soyuz-2 Fregat rocket carrying a lunar landing craft has blasted off on what Russia hopes will be its first successful moon landing mission
								    in nearly 50 years.<br>

                                    The unmanned Luna-25 mission launched in the early hours of Friday on a journey to the moon that is expected to take about five days. A landing
								    date has not been announced.<br>

                                    The Luna-25 mission will seek to land near the south pole of the moon, collecting geological samples from the area, and sending back data for 
								    signs of water or its building blocks, which could raise the possibility of a future human colony on the moon.<br>

							<h2>BLUE ORIGIN SOLAR CELLS</h2>

								<span> FEBUARY 10, 2023</span>
						            Since 2021, Blue Origin has been making solar cells and transmission wire from regolith simulants.<br>

                                    To make long-term presence on the Moon viable, we need abundant electrical power. We can make power systems on the Moon directly from materials that exist
						            everywhere on the surface, without special substances brought from Earth. We have pioneered the technology and demonstrated all the steps. Our approach, 
						            Blue Alchemist, can scale indefinitely, eliminating power as a constraint anywhere on the Moon.<br>

							<h2>BLUE ORIGIN SELECTED BY NASA FOR MOON MISSION</h2>

									NASA Selects Blue Origin for Astronaut Mission to the Moon<br>
									KENT, WA -- NASA has awarded a NextSTEP-2 Appendix P Sustaining Lunar Development (SLD) contract to Blue Origin. Blue Origin’s National Team partners include Lockheed 
									Martin, Draper, Boeing, Astrobotic, and Honeybee Robotics.<br>  
									
									Under this contract, Blue Origin and its National Team partners will develop and fly both a lunar lander that can make a precision landing anywhere on the Moon’s surface
									and a cislunar transporter. These vehicles are powered by LOX-LH2. The high-specific impulse of LOX-LH2 provides a dramatic advantage for high-energy deep space missions.<br>

								<span> AUGUST 10, 2023</span>
									VIRGIN GALACTIC, the spaceflight company, accomplished its second commercial spaceflight named Galactic 02. The flight marked a milestone as it carried its inaugural group 
									of private-paying tourists.<br>
									 Departing from Spaceport America in New Mexico the spacecraft was piloted by CJ Sturckow and Kelly Latimer.
									Accompanying them were four others: Beth Moses, the chief astronaut trainer overseeing the mission,and a trio of passengers.<br>

								The payload on today's launch was the Galaxy 37/Horizons-4 communications satellite that will be jointly operated by Intelsat and JSAT International. The Maxar-built satellite 
								will expand television and telecommunications access for North America and help free up swaths of the airwaves for 5G wireless communications service, according to a Maxar statement.<br>
